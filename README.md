## What is implemented?

We focus on incomplete-information (Bayesian) games with continuous type and action space. 
By discretizing the type and action space, and using distributional strategies, we can apply standard (gradient-based) learning algorithms to approximate Bayes-Nash equilibria (BNE) of given mechanisms.

#### Mechanisms

- Single-Item Auctions <br>*first- and second-price auctions with risk-aversion, different utility functions (quasi-linear, return-on-invest, return-on-spent)*
- All-Pay Auctions<br>
 *first- and second-price (war of attrition), risk aversion*
- LLG-Auction <br>
  *small combinatorial auction with 2 items, 2 local bidders, and 1 global bidder and correlated valuations of local bidders*
- Split-Award Auction <br> 
 *procurement auction with 2 agents and (dis-)economies of scale*
- Tullock Contests <br> *different discrimination parameters*

#### Learning Algorithms

- Dual Averaging <br> *Gradient ascent with lazy projection, exponentiated gradient ascent*
- Mirror Ascent <br> *projected gradient ascent, exponentiated gradient ascent*
- Frank-Wolfe Algorithm
- Fictitious Play

## How can I use the code
After setting up the repository (see Installation) you can either run experiments using the method in [main.py](./main.py) or you can checkout the [notebooks](./notebooks/) for a more detailed introduction.

<details> <summary> Installation </summary>

Note: These setup instructions assume a Linux-based OS and uses python 3.8.10 (or higher).

Install virtualenv (or whatever you prefer for virtual envs)
```bash
sudo apt-get install virtualenv
```

Create a virtual environment with virtual env (you can also choose your own name)

```bash
virtualenv venv
```

You can specify the python version for the virtual environment via the -p flag. 
Note that this version already needs to be installed on the system (e.g. `virtualenv - p python3 venv` uses the 
standard python3 version from the system).

activate the environment with
```bash
source ./venv/bin/activate
```
Install all requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt`
```
Install the soda package.

```bash
pip install -e .
```
You can also run "pip install ." if you don't want to edit the code. The "-e" flag ensures that pip does not copy the code but uses the editable files instead.

## Install pre-commit hooks (for development)
Install pre-commit hooks for your project

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Verify by running on all files:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```
