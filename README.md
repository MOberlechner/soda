## What is implemented?

We focus on incomplete-information (Bayesian) games with continuous type and action space. 
By discretizing the type and action space, and using distributional strategies, we can apply standard (gradient-based) learning algorithms to approximate Bayes-Nash equilibria (BNE) of given mechanisms.

#### Mechanisms

- Single-Item Auctions (first- and second-price auctions with risk-aversion, ...)
- All-Pay Auctions (first- and second-price, i.e. War of attrition)
- LLG-Auction (small combinatorial auction with 2 items, 2 local bidders, and 1 global bidder)
- Split-Award Auction (procurement auction with 2 agents)
- Tullock Contests

#### Learning Algorithms

- Dual Averaging (Gradient ascent with lazy projection, exponentiated gradient ascent)
- Mirror Ascent (projected gradient ascent, exponentiated gradient ascent)
- Frank-Wolfe Algorithm
- Fictitious Play
